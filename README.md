## Technical Specifications
### The main focus of this project was on the functionality and features of the website, rather than the frontend design. However, some design elements have been incorporated using Bootstrap 5 and custom CSS styles.

For the backend development, I used Python 3 Django web framework along with HTML, Jinja, and CSS. Django allowed us to implement various features such as user authentication, item creation, commenting, bidding, and more. I also utilized Django's built-in models to interact with the database and store the necessary information.

Overall, this project aimed to create a functional and efficient website that would allow users to easily buy and sell items. Future improvements to the frontend design could be made to further enhance the user experience.
